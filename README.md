Multi-Project Repository

This repository is a collection of projects, each designed to address specific needs and challenges. The goal is to offer a range of solutions that cater to different interests and skillsets. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the projects and their significance:

Project 1: Drowsy Driver Detection

Description: Drowsy driver detection is a critical aspect of ensuring road safety, as fatigue-related accidents contribute significantly to road accidents worldwide. In this digital image processing mini project, we developed a system to detect drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques. The system utilized the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) algorithm along with Haar cascades for face and eye detection. By capturing video frames from a webcam and processing them in real-time, the system identified faces and extracted eye regions for further analysis. The EAR, calculated based on the spatial relationships of eye landmarks, served as an indicator of drowsiness. Upon detecting a low EAR below a predefined threshold, the system triggered an alert message and played an alarm sound using Pygame. This provided a timely warning to the driver, prompting them to take necessary action to combat drowsiness. Overall, this project contributes to the field of computer vision-based drowsiness detection and has potential applications in improving road safety.
